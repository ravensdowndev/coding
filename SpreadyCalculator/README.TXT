Hi, 

A few notes.

There are lots of ways to do this.  For example, I don't store the cell data which could be done in a list or 2d array.  I just calculate the result.  

Lots of for loops.  Some of the parsing might be possible with regexes.  

Solution in a separate assembly so I could run some extra validation tests.

Note documentation is limited due to time.

Total dev time ~35 mins incuding testing.
